Time Complexity | Space Complexity
--------------- | --------------
Analysis of the runtime of an algorithm as the size of the input increases | How much additional memory do we need to allocate in order to run the code in an algorithm

## Auxiliary Space Complexity

Refers to the space required by the algorithm, NOT including the space taken up by the inputs.

### Rules of Thumb:
* Most primitives (booleans, numbers, undefined, null) are constant space
* Strings require O(n) space (n = String length)
* Reference types are generally O(n), n => length (for Arrays) or Number of Keys (for Objects)
