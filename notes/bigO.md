#Big O Notation

Prolems can have multiple solutions, Big O: Determines "best" solution for said problem.

Problem with time based performance measuring:

* Different machines record different times.
* Same machines record different times.
* Fast alogrithms speed measurements not precise enough.

Counting operations is more accurate.

## Description:

Formalized fuzzy counting

Formal way to talk about how the runtime of an algorithm grows as the inputs grows.

Describing the relationship of the input size with that of the time relative to said input

Big O tests the worst case scenario or the "Upper bound" for runtime

# Notation:

O(f(n))

* f(n) could be linear (f(n) = n) 
* f(n) could be quadratic (f(n) = n^2)
* f(n) could be constant (f(n) = 1) 
* f(n) could be something else
