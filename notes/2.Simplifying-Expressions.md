## Constants Don't Matter

* O(2n) => O(n)
* O(500) => O(1)
* O(13n^2) => O(n^2)


## Smaller Terms Don't Matter 
* O(n + 10) => O(n)
* O(1000n + 50) => O(n)
* O(n^2 + 5n + 8) => O(n^2)

## Shorthands
1. Arithmetic operations are constant
2. Variable assignment is constant
3. Accessing elements in an array (by index) or object (by key) is constant
4. In a loop, complexity is the length of the loop times complexity of inner loop
